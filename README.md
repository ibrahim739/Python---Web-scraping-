# Python---Web-scraping
You will get a Python script which scrapes HTML using BeautifulSoup.
This program will use urllib to read the HTML from a specific url (specified by you (the user) ) , parse the data, and then treat and extract the needed information from the data depending on the user specification (for example, extracting numbers and compute the sum of the numbers in the line)

The user should provide the URL needed for the python script in order to scrape for the desired data
